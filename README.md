This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl when modifying a hash during iteration using the each function.  The `bug.pl` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises because `each` maintains an internal pointer, and modifying the hash structure during iteration can disrupt this pointer causing unexpected behavior like skipping elements or infinite loops. The solution demonstrates a safer way to iterate and modify hashes.
